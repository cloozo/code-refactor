Horiseon:

 Horiseon Social Media Marketing & Search Engine Optimization (Code Refactor) 


Task Completed

    In the CSS File, to make it easy for whoever wants to understand the login behind my codes, I commented the top of the page with the comments:
    /* Universal selector that applies to all styling for all elements on the page */, along where the Body elements of the page with the /* Element selectors */

    
    During the course of the project,  the page has been refactored for Web accessibility  with better code to facilitate access for people with disabilities .  Alt Text were added to the images, HTML elements has been replaced with  Semantic HTML. I also added a more descriptive title.
    The use of header, section, aside and footer was applied to help make the code easier with the Search Engines optimization.
    I added comments before the different sections of the page to make my codes easier to understand by others.
    To help with this project, besides the materials I learned from the classes, I have also  used many online resources.  Below is a list of a few of the resources  I have used to find answers to some questions I had.
