In the Css File, I commented the top of the page with the coments:
/* Universal secletor that applies to all styling for all elements on the page */, along where the Body elements of the page with the /* Element selectors */

During this project, Web accessibility  where visibility for people with disabilies were done by using Semantic HTML and CSS were done. To help me with this project, besides the materials I learned from the classes, I have also  used many online resources like.
